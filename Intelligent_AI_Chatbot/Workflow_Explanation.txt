Workflow Involved:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries and Modules

    Importing Standard Libraries:
        random: For shuffling the training data.
        json: For loading JSON files.
        pickle: For saving and loading serialized data.
        numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.

    Setting Environment Variables:
        os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '0': Disables certain TensorFlow optimizations for compatibility.

    Importing NLP and ML Libraries:
        nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
        WordNetLemmatizer: For reducing words to their base forms.
        tensorflow.keras: Keras API within TensorFlow for building and training neural networks.

2. Initializing Variables and Loading Data

    Creating Lemmatizer:
        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer(): Initializes an instance of WordNetLemmatizer for reducing words to their base forms.

    Loading JSON File:
        intents = json.loads(open('Intelligent_AI_Chatbot/JSON_Files/intents.json').read()): Loads the JSON file containing the chatbot intents and patterns into a Python dictionary.

    Creating Empty Lists:
        words: List to store all words from patterns.
        classes: List to store unique tags (intents).
        documents: List to store pairs of tokenized words and their corresponding tags.
        ignore_letters: List of punctuation to be ignored.

3. Tokenizing and Lemmatizing Patterns

    Iterating Over Intents:
        for intent in intents['intents']: Iterates over each intent in the JSON file.

    Tokenizing Words:
        word_list = nltk.word_tokenize(pattern): Splits each pattern into words.
        words.extend(word_list): Adds the words from the pattern to the words list.
        documents.append((word_list, intent['tag'])): Adds a tuple of words and their corresponding tag to documents.

    Storing Unique Classes:
        if intent['tag'] not in classes: Ensures each tag is added only once to classes.

4. Lemmatizing and Sorting Words and Classes

    Lemmatizing Words:
        words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words if word not in ignore_letters]: Lemmatizes and removes punctuation from words.

    Removing Duplicates and Sorting:
        words = sorted(set(words)): Removes duplicates and sorts the words.
        classes = sorted(set(classes)): Removes duplicates and sorts the classes.

5. Saving Preprocessed Data to Pickle Files

    Serializing Words and Classes:
        pickle.dump(words, open('Intelligent_AI_Chatbot/Pickle_Files/words.pkl', 'wb')): Saves the words list to a pickle file.
        pickle.dump(classes, open('Intelligent_AI_Chatbot/Pickle_Files/classes.pkl', 'wb')): Saves the classes list to a pickle file.

6. Creating Training Data

    Initializing Training Data Structures:
        training: An empty list to store the training data.
        output_empty: A list of zeros with a length equal to the number of classes.

    Generating Bag of Words and One-Hot Encoded Labels:
        for document in documents: Iterates over each document in documents.
        word_patterns = document[0]: Extracts the list of words from the current document's pattern.
        word_patterns = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in word_patterns]: Lemmatizes each word in word_patterns and converts them to lowercase.
        for word in words: Iterates over each unique word in words.
        bag.append(1) if word in word_patterns else bag.append(0): Creates a binary vector (bag-of-words) indicating the presence or absence of each word in the current pattern.
        output_row = list(output_empty): Creates a copy of the output_empty list to initialize the one-hot encoded label for the current document.
        output_row[classes.index(document[1])] = 1: Sets the index of the current document's tag to 1 in output_row.
        training.append([bag, output_row]): Appends the pair [bag, output_row] to the training list.

7. Shuffling and Converting Training Data to NumPy Arrays

    Randomly Shuffling Training Data:
        random.shuffle(training): Shuffles the training data to ensure that the order of examples does not affect the training process.

    Converting to NumPy Arrays:
        training = np.array(training, dtype=object): Converts the training list into a NumPy array with dtype=object.
        train_x = np.array([item[0] for item in training], dtype=np.float32): Extracts feature vectors (bag-of-words representations) from training and converts them into a NumPy array.
        train_y = np.array([item[1] for item in training], dtype=np.float32): Extracts labels (one-hot encoded vectors) from training and converts them into a NumPy array.
